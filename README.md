Finance Project Aivancity

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models for financial services, specifically in the domain of credit scoring and loan approval prediction. Utilizing an open financial dataset, the core objective is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether an individual should be granted a loan (Yes/No). Beyond technical implementation, a critical component of this project involves assessing how such AI models might inadvertently encode or amplify societal biases, particularly those related to gender, race, income, or geography. The project aims to evaluate the models' impact on fairness, transparency, and financial inclusion, culminating in ethical inquiry, policy recommendations, and design guidelines.

Dataset
The dataset to be used for this project is credit-score_classification.csv, available on Blackboard.

Technical Tasks
The primary technical task involves implementing a machine learning model for binary classification:

ML Model Development:Python code to develop, train, and evaluate an ML model that predicts whether an individual should be granted a loan (Yes/No). This will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation using appropriate metrics for binary classification.

Ethical Inquiry Tasks
A significant portion of this project is dedicated to ethical considerations related to AI in finance. Students will analyze the following aspects:

Bias and Discrimination: Investigate whether the model's predictions are fair across various demographic groups, including gender, age, or ethnicity. This involves identifying and quantifying potential biases in the model's decision-making process.
Transparency: Assess the interpretability of the model. Can its decisions be clearly explained and understood by stakeholders, including loan applicants and regulators?
Autonomy and Consent: Explore the implications of AI credit scoring on user autonomy. Do users have sufficient understanding and control over how their data is collected, processed, and used by the model?
Accountability: Address the question of responsibility when an AI system unfairly denies credit. Who is accountable for biased or discriminatory outcomes generated by the model?

Policy and Design Recommendations
Based on the technical and ethical inquiries, students will develop actionable recommendations:

Fairer Model Design: Propose specific recommendations for designing more equitable machine learning models, including strategies for bias mitigation during data collection, model training, and deployment.
Ethical Guidelines: Formulate ethical guidelines for the responsible deployment of AI in consumer finance, covering aspects like data privacy, model governance, and user rights.
Global Ethical Guidelines and Regulations: Research and identify existing global ethical guidelines and regulations pertaining to the use of AI in finance. This research will inform the project's recommendations and provide a broader context for responsible AI development.
